Methods for Numerical Integration and others things

This a brief summary of different forms of maths implementation on Python. 
First of all, I'm learning about mathematical forms for using to Numeric Integration to solve particularity problems in Magnets Models applying in accelerators.

## Useful Background Information
The Python software is used to demonstrate and execute the most of commands and formulas. The formulas contained are based in the previous concepts and theorems.
